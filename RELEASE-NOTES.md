# slot. for Android — v2.2.1

This update brings a native Cart Studio built into slot. for Android, labels from slot.'s own database, cheats and new shaders.

### Fixed in 2.2.1

- Simpletex on the Game Boy Advance no longer has its own colour correction: Color Correction can now be turned on or off with it, as with every other shader.
- Refresh Library's progress keeps the width of its text, top right.

### What's New

- **Native Cart Studio** — Cart Studio is now built directly into slot. for Android. Press **X** on a cartridge to change its label (Real Label, Logo Only, Search label, or your own picture), shell colour, finish and shape. **START → Cart Studio** shows every cartridge of a system: **L1 / R1** change the system, **L2 / R2** jump between letters, **Y** saves all changes. It replaces the web Cart Studio.
- **Our own label database** — Labels now come from slot. for Android's own database, art.slot-android.app, for every system, rom hacks included. ScreenScraper only fills in what it doesn't have yet. Labels now download about five times faster.
- **Cheats** — RetroArch's cheat database is built in for the Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, NES, Super Nintendo and Mega Drive. Open **Cheats** in the game menu.
- **LCD Effect** — Matt Akins' Pixel Transparency and Sunlight Shimmer on the Game Boy, Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance.
- **New shaders** — Dot Matrix on the Game Boy. crt-easymode, crt-hyllian, SABR, Super Eagle and xBR-lv2 on the NES, Super Nintendo and Mega Drive.
- **Dither Blending** — Mega Drive dithering blends as it did on a TV.
- **Status Bar** — Clock and battery at the top or bottom, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth in one row, apps All, Running or Off, New installs show the clock and battery at the top.
- **Screenshot hotkey** — Set it in **Settings → Controls → Hotkeys**. Screenshots go to Pictures/Screenshots. ([#86](https://github.com/Baggio94/slot-for-android/issues/86))
- **Scan progress** — The first library scan shows a progress bar and a count; Refresh Library shows its progress top right. ([#102](https://github.com/Baggio94/slot-for-android/issues/102))
- **Interface** — Settings → General is now Interface. With the Shelf wallpaper, choose which shelf each wallpaper goes to.
- **Console slots** — The NES, Famicom, Super Nintendo and Mega Drive slots fit their cartridges.

### Fixed

- Pokémon: Save and Eject no longer fails after loading a save state made before the first in-game save. ([#103](https://github.com/Baggio94/slot-for-android/issues/103))
- An older auto-state no longer resumes over a newer in-game save.
- A clear cartridge's lid no longer lifts with the board drawn on it.
- Simpletex shows its paper texture again.
